# ChromeClash
An extension for the Counter-Strike 2 social arcade which reveals hidden statistics on skins, win percentages.<br>
Alert the user of an upcoming “Rain” event. 

## Why?
Clash.gg doesn't show you the full float value for the steam P2P skins on clash.<br>
I also wanted to be alerted when a rain event started.

## TO DO
- [ ] Add a building tool such as Vite to minimize variable context leakage.
- [ ] Implement the same float functionality for the WaxPeer withdrawl tab.
- [ ] Add to Chrome Web Store (free)

## Setup
1. Download this repository, ensure when you unzip it the folder name is "ChromeClash"
2. Click the puzzle piece in the top right section of your Chrome browser
3. Click "Manage extensions"
4. In the top right corner, click the "Developer mode" toggle
5. On the left-hand side, click "Load unpacked"
6. Find and select the folder for the repository you just downloaded
7. Make sure it's on, and head over to clash.gg!

##### If you did it right, you should see this on the extensions page:
